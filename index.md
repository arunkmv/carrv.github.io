# Second Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V (CARRV 2018)

## Los Angeles, CA, USA, June 2, 2018, Co-located with ISCA 2018

The Second Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V
(CARRV) brings together researchers in fields related to computer
architecture, compilers, and systems for technical exchange on using
RISC-V in computer architecture research.  Submission of early work is
encouraged. The topics of specific interest for the workshop include,
but are not limited to:

* RISC-V simulation/emulation infrastructures, including ports of
  existing infrastructures
* Easily modifiable RISC-V RTL cores to support research
* Whole-SoC simulators/emulators and/or models built around RISC-V
* Machine-readable formal models and verification methodologies
* Compiler toolchains and operating system ports to support systems research
* RISC-V-based research prototypes
* Security architecture research
* Memory model research
* Quantitative comparison of RISC-V with other ISAs

The workshop is intended to be highly interactive with an open session
discussing experiences with using the current state of the RISC-V
ecosystem for architecture research and what directions to take to
improve it.

## Important Dates

* Abstract submission deadline: March 10, 2018
* Full paper submission deadline: March 17, 2018 23:59 PST
* Author notification: April 8, 2017
* Camera-ready version due: May 19, 2018

## Organizers

* Arvind (MIT)
* Krste Asanovic (University of California, Berkeley)
* Silviu Chiricescu (BAE Systems R&D)
* Yunsup Lee (SiFive)
* Michael Taylor (University of Washington)

## Submission Guidelines

All papers should be submitted electronically by
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=carrv2018). Submissions
in PDF format must be limited to 6 pages including figures and tables,
plus as many pages as needed for references. Papers must be in PDF
format and should include title, authors and affiliation, e-mail
address of the contact author.

Papers must be formatted in accordance to the ACM two column
style. ACM Word or LaTeX style templates are available
[here](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Note: Authors may submit to both CARRV and the 8th RISC-V Workshop,
but please remember that CARRV has an explicit research focus.

Note: Workshop publications do not preclude publishing at future
conference venues.
