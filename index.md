# First Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V (CARRV 2017)

## Boston, MA, USA, October 14, 2017, Co-located with MICRO 2017

The First Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V
(CARRV) brings together researchers in fields related to computer
architecture, compilers, and systems for technical exchange on using
RISC-V in computer architecture research.  Submission of early work is
encouraged. The topics of specific interest for the workshop include,
but are not limited to:

* RISC-V simulation/emulation infrastructures, including ports of
  existing infrastructures
* Easily modifiable RISC-V RTL cores to support research
* Whole-SoC simulators/emulators and/or models built around RISC-V
* RISC-V-based research prototypes
* Machine-readable formal models and verification methodologies
* Compiler toolchains and operating system ports to support systems research
* Security architecture research
* Memory model research
* Quantitative comparison of RISC-V with other ISAs

The workshop is intended to be highly interactive with an open session
discussing experiences with using the current state of the RISC-V
ecosystem for architecture research and what directions to take to
improve it.
